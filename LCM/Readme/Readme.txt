This code is a continuation of the stock Floatwheel LCM (Light Control Module). This version offers added features. On the side off the LCM an expended messaging structure was added (to work in combination with the Comm bridge that was created in a custom Float Package).
EEPROM writes and reads, store settings on the LCM without having to flash again. This brings some features such as changing the preset lighting profiles, remembering which profile was last used, changing boot animation and cell type and more.

TODO:
Include Float package buzzer support (let the vesc controll the buzzer).
